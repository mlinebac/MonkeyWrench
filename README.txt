Project 1: Monkey Wrench

The topic of this game is Bobo the monkey. Bobo currently resides in a laboratory and after some time of experimentation finds the opportunity to escape the lab. Bobo must then escape the laboratory by reaching the ceiling of each level.

The purpose of this game is to navigate Bobo to the top of each level in order to escape. The arrow keys as well as w, a, and d can be used to control Bobo with w for jumping, a for walking right, and d for walking left. There are also cages along the route Bobo must take. Encountering a cage will trigger a sliding puzzle which can be solved by moving the provided peices into their correct order. Once the puzzle is completed, Bobo will be free of the cage and will be able to continue on his journey.
